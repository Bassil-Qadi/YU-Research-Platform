 * Badge colours for everything that carries a status or a role.

 * was green on the admin dashboard and teal in the user table. One definition,
 * imported everywhere, so that cannot happen again.
 *
 * Each value is a tint plus readable text in both themes. Callers add their own
 * shape (rounded-full, text size, borders).
